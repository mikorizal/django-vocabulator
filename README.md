# django-vocabulator

Temporary website: http://valueflows.pythonanywhere.com/

A demo for the emerging valueflows vf vocabulary: enter your examples, generate Linked Open Data in several formats using the vf:concepts.

Generated formats include rdf-xml, n-triples, n3, turtle, yaml, json-ld, and json. To come: csv.

Implemented using the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), where the path of least resistance is to use a relational database. So this app also demonstrates translating from relational models to Linked Open Data. 

To install locally for development, see [install.txt](https://github.com/valueflows/django-vocabulator/blob/master/docs/install.txt).
